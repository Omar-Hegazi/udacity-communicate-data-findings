# Findings
The trip distribution over day is most active between 8am-9am and 17pm-18pm with a small difference, and also it appears that the majority of rides happened on work day from Monday to Friday maybe most of them use the service for commuting.through 2018, October had the most ride trips compared to the others, but generally it was high usage from May to Septemper. I also observed that Most of users are under subscriber type, the vast majority of them are male gender , and most of the users are abour 35 years old and the majority between 20 and 45.
The idea of renting a bike for either going to work or to have some fun is great and wonderful. It helps to have much clean environment. Most of the riders are males. most of the users are subscriber and commuters there primary usage is for work. Customers are tourists, visitors or citizens who love riding bikes.
